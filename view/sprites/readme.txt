These are basically just wire frames of the hero, enemy and a random block(we'll say it is a rock though).
Use them to render the hero, obstacles and the enemy units.

They are formatted in a simple to understand manner.
Each file tells you what dimensions the object occupies.
The remaining lines are the wire frame itself.

The idea in regrds to storage of these objects is going to rely on the use of the sting
